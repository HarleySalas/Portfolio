## Portfolio Website - Harley Salas

This was a quick project to display my portfolio and begin looking for a remote job.
Looking at it after completion, I wish I'd gone with a lighter theme but, it's done for now.

- Built with Gatsby.
- Utilizes functional components and React Hooks, entirely.
- Styles with SCSS.
- Deployed on Netlify.
