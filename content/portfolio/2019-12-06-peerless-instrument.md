  Peerless Instrument is a precision CNC manufacturing facility based in
  Hollywood, FL. I was commissioned to build an entirely new website for them,
  which would both mobile friendly, and modern. After touring their facility and
  taking pictures, I built this website from the ground up, including 100% custom
  assets. Please note that this site is currently hosted on a test server, as it is incomplete, awaiting more copywriting and content adjustments from the client.
---It had been quite some time since Peerless Instrument's last website redesign. Their previous website was built in 2003. Being a family owned business since 1968, it provided me with a fulfilling opportunity to bring their web presence in to the modern age.

Their long history, state of the art equipment and reliability earned them big name clients and further work through word of mouth. Often these days, your website is what gives potential clients their first impression of you. I took it as my responsibility to ensure that they could also be proud of their website and leave a positive impression on future clients.

I toured their facility in Hollywood, FL and learned about their business. During this time, I took numerous photos and videos of both their facility and products. Absolutely every aspect of their website is an entirely custom asset. I made all of the icons and illustrations in Illustrator, the hero video in After Effects and vectorized all of their client logos for their home page. This allowed me to present them with something entirely uniform and unique.

This project has gotten me excited to work on projects for businesses of this sphere. In the future, I'd love to build something with more complex brand requirements, features and scalability. Provided the correct budget and time, I believe there are a lot of unique concepts that could be implemented.
