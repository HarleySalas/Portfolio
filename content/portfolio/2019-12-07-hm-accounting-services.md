  The client, Horacio Moreno Accounting Services, LLC requested a simple website
  to gather client emails and maintain an online presence. The project is
  complete with a small blog, ActiveCampaign API integration for their CRM, and
  a mailing form.

HM Accounting Services didn't have a web presence and desired something simple and quick. The website requirements were to display their services, receive client emails for their mailing list and make it easy to contact them.

As the client was familiar with WordPress, we decided that Wordpress would be a good choice for them. This was my first time building a Wordpress theme from scratch though. I managed to develop it with React, implement the Active Campaign API to integrate with their CRM and add emails to their platform from the website.

The greatest challenge of this site was the time constraint, and limited content. The site was originally designed as a multi-page site, but was rebuilt as a single page application on Wordpress, considering that there simply wasn't enough content to make each page meaningful. This project was a good lesson for me in making sure that the level of copy/content provided will be sufficient for the implementation. There's definitely aspects of the site I wish I could have done better and will hopefully revisit in the future. One of the most difficult challenges for me is to let a project go live while knowing it could be a lot better. Ultimately, I learned to manage web projects more efficiently and how to approach things in the future to ensure that projects are completed on time and with a higher standard. Ultimately, the client was happy with the outcome though.
